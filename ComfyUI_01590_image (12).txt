The scene opens with the paper-crafted woman gracefully spinning in place, her elaborate orange and blue dress fluttering with every step. Her paper curls bounce softly as she moves through an elegant dance, surrounded by a whimsical paper garden. The camera slowly circles her, capturing the motion of her layered outfit and the delicate rustle of her form as if life were breathed into paper. Light filters through the leaves, adding a dreamlike shimmer to her poetic performance.
