The woman undergoes a mesmerizing transformation, triggered by an alien virus. As the organic, spider-web-like structure slowly spreads over her body, she caresses it with elegance and visible delight. Her eyes glow softly, and her breath deepens in ecstasy. The camera pulls back, revealing her full form as the transformation continuesâ€”her movements graceful, almost ritualistic. Bioluminescent patterns pulse across her skin, and the forest around her subtly shifts in color and texture, responding to her metamorphosis.
