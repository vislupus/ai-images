A woman, born of fire, ascends from the molten earth and walks powerfully toward the viewer through a charred canyon. Her skin glistens with heat, her fiery hair flows like a solar flare, and her blazing dress crackles with embers at every step. The camera captures her from a low angle as lava erupts in the distance and the sky glows with an apocalyptic light. She is the living embodiment of flameâ€”the fire avatar returning to the surface.
