The scene opens in a magical forest clearing with golden light filtering through the trees. The fox-girl stands still, eyes glowing softly. She gently lifts her hand, and shimmering petals begin to swirl in the air. The camera slowly circles her, capturing the light playing off her soft hair and fluttering dress. Her expression turns into a knowing smile as she tilts her head â€” the forest subtly pulses with her magic.
