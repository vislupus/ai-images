The camera glides silently through a vast, glowing crystal cave. Sparkling blue and amber light refracts from giant crystals, casting dancing reflections on the water below. As it moves deeper, the formations grow larger and more intricate. Finally, the camera approaches the centerpiece—a colossal, luminous crystal at the cavern’s core, pulsing with energy, as if guarding a mystical secret.
