Moments before the end of the world, the camera opens on a woman standing atop a high-rise rooftop. She looks up at a burning sky where a massive, fiery celestial body looms. Her hair flows in the wind as she silently watches the collapse unfold. The camera then rapidly pulls back, rising higher and higher to reveal cities in chaos, fires spreading, oceans rising, and the sky cracking open — a breathtaking final glimpse of Earth’s last moments.
