A glowing angelic figure with orange-tipped wings steps forward from a celestial backdrop. As the camera moves in, she gently flaps her wings and smiles with divine warmth. She closes the distance with slow, graceful steps, then opens her arms and draws the viewer into a radiant embrace. Light flows from her being, wrapping the scene in peaceful golden warmth, as if her hug dissolves all fear and brings pure comfort.
