In a mystical winter realm, an ethereal ice queen slowly walks through a glistening snow-covered forest. Her elegant silver gown sparkles with every step, the fur-lined cloak trailing behind her as if part of the snowstorm. The camera glides around her in slow motion, capturing the movement of snowflakes, the glint of her crown, and the serene power in her expression. Her presence radiates timeless beauty and frosty magic.
