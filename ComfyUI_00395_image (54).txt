A cinematic sequence of an ethereal katagami woman gracefully dancing in a mystical autumn forest. Her paper-like gown sways with every delicate movement, as golden-orange leaves swirl around her in the crisp air. As she twirls, light reflects off her delicate, layered design, making her appear almost weightless, like a living work of art. The camera captures slow-motion shots of her paper-crafted antlers glowing softly under the warm autumn sunlight. Her golden eyes shine as she playfully reaches out toward the viewer, inviting them into her enchanting world of paper and nature.
