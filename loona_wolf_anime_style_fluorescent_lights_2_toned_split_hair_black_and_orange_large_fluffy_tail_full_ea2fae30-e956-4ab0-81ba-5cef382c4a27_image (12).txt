The scene opens with a mysterious woman, glowing in orange and black, her flaming hands illuminating the darkness around her. As ambient music plays, she turns gracefully, showing her back to the camera. Her long hair and tails move with the rhythm. She dances in a slow, fluid motion, occasionally casting subtle glances over her shoulder toward the viewerâ€”curious, playful, and aware. The spotlight follows her, capturing her movements in shadow and flame.
