The scene opens in a gothic hall illuminated by roaring flames. The red-haired sorceress steps forward, her gown flowing like smoke. With a flick of her fingers, flaming roses lift into the air and spiral around her. She moves with poise, each step casting embers from her heels. The flames respond to her presence—swaying, burning brighter—until she raises a single rose to her lips and blows a fiery kiss into the air.
