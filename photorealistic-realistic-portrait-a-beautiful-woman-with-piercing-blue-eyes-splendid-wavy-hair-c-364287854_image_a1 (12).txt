Create a magical night-time animation of a goddess-like woman in a flowing, jeweled royal blue gown dancing beneath a glowing full moon in an autumn forest. Her silver hair floats with each graceful movement as golden leaves spiral around her. The scene is silent except for the gentle chime of magic, as glowing particles ripple with every step. The moon illuminates her figure as she performs the Dance of the Night, a ritual that awakens the spirits of the forest under her celestial command.
