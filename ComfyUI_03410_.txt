The Night Queen begins to walk slowly and regally toward the camera, each step measured with the elegance of dark royalty. The camera slowly pulls back, as if retreating from her growing presence, revealing her full figure and the sharp, commanding beauty of her attire. Her flowing black gown and crown of ice shimmer with power. As the camera retreats, she suddenly reaches forward and grabs it with unnatural speed, pulling it close to her face. Her expression twists into a chilling, wicked smileâ€”hinting that she has sinister plans for whoever is watching.
