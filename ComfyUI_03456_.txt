After countless experiments, the cybernetic woman has broken free—and now seeks global assimilation. She raises her arms with divine grace and pulls the camera toward her. Dozens of glowing cables shoot out, piercing into the camera, distorting the image. Her mechanical implants begin to retract and dissolve, revealing her true form: a radiant, godlike being of terrifying beauty. A wicked smile spreads across her face as she steps closer, her eyes glowing. She whispers a final, incomprehensible phrase—one that marks the end of all resistance. From this moment forward, we belong to her. She is all that matters now.
