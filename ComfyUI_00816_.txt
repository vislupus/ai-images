The scene begins with a close-up of a breathtaking girl surrounded by swirling orange and white paper leaves. She looks at the viewer—her beloved—with a delicate blush and a slight smile that grows into a soft, radiant laugh. The camera slowly pulls back, revealing her elegant figure as she starts walking gracefully toward her love, the paper leaves fluttering gently around her. Everything glows with warmth and emotion, as if love itself is dancing in the air.
