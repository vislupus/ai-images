The witch gracefully begins to dance, holding the glowing jack-o'-lantern in both hands. Her slow, elegant movements are hypnotic, matching the mystical rhythm of a haunting Halloween melody. As she dances, the pumpkins around her come to life, swaying and harmonizing with the tune. The atmosphere is haunting yet irresistibly enchanting, with flickering candlelight and rustling leaves. The camera follows her fluid motion, capturing the magical connection between her and the enchanted pumpkins.
