A majestic woman with fiery orange wings walks gracefully through an endless corridor, the patterns on her elegant blue floral suit shimmering in the soft light. The ancient hallway stretches infinitely, lined with intricate carvings and floating autumn leaves that swirl around her with every step. As she moves forward, she approaches the viewer, her intense gaze locking for a fleeting moment before she passes by with ethereal grace. Her wings flicker like flames, casting a warm glow on the walls. Slowly, she continues her journey into the distance, fading into eternity, leaving only a lingering presence behind.
