A cinematic sequence begins with a futuristic cyborg woman walking slowly towards the viewer in a dimly lit cybernetic laboratory. The cold metallic sheen of her body reflects flickering neon lights. As she moves closer, her synthetic skin begins to split open, revealing an intricate network of glowing cables and biomechanical tendrils pulsating with energy. The cables begin to extend outward, reaching for the viewer, moving like living creatures. The camera focuses on her faceâ€”a wicked yet ecstatic smile as she softly whispers, welcoming the viewer into her digital consciousness. The final moment shows the cables wrapping around the camera, pulling the viewer into her cybernetic embrace as the screen glitches into darkness.
