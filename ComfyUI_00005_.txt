In a scorched battlefield of dark towers and roaring fire, a demon queen rises. As the camera pans slowly around her, she begins to danceâ€”elegant yet ominous. Her wings unfurl, her armored figure moves with a haunting rhythm. Flames slither around her feet, responding to her every motion. Her eyes never waver, locked on the viewer as her deadly performance unfolds, a hypnotic display of grace infused with terror.
