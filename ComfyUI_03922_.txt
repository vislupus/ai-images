The camera slowly pulls away from the ice princess, then begins circling around her as she gazes gently at it with graceful poise. She begins a soft, flowing dance, each movement light and enchanting. As she twirls and moves, the crystal formations around her shift and change, responding to her magical presenceâ€”some bloom like icy flowers, others levitate and refract light in dazzling patterns. The scene shimmers with delicate magic.
