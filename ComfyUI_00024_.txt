The girl begins dancing playfully under the moonlight, surrounded by glowing pumpkins and twinkling lights. Her movements are fun and energetic, perfectly matching a Halloween-themed birthday celebration. She twirls, claps, and does a silly spooky gesture, as bats flutter overhead and leaves swirl around. The camera pans to show her full joyful dance, ending with her laughing and waving at the birthday person.
