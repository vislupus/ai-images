In the heart of a ruined cathedral shrouded in mist and shadows, a necromancer queen begins her ritual. Glowing runes form around her as her hands rise, and streams of violet and black energy swirl violently. Her voice echoes with ancient words as dark forces respond to her call. The camera spins around her, capturing the eruption of infernal energy that shakes the very ground, as she awakens the darkest powers of the world.
