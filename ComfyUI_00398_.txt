In an ethereal forest sanctuary, the mysterious elemental woman slowly begins to dance. Her hair flows like flame, and her gestures summon glowing sparks and wind that spiral around her. The camera circles her fluidly as her antlers catch golden light, revealing ancient markings and symbols lighting up across her body with every move. The dance feels like a magical riteâ€”mesmerizing, graceful, and charged with power.
