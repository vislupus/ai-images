Create a cinematic winter fantasy scene where a graceful ice queen stands amidst a glowing frozen forest. Her breath is visible in the frigid air, but a warm smile plays on her lips as she reaches out a hand. Magical snowflakes swirl gently around her, and soft blue light pulses from the heart-shaped jewel on her chest. As a companion steps into frame and takes her hand, the coldness transforms into a feeling of warmth and unity. The message is clear: the cold isnâ€™t scary when shared with a friend.
