The woman, dressed in living fire and lava, begins to dance slowly and gracefully in the heart of a charred forest. With each movement, the flames ripple and spiral around her body, reacting to her every gesture like sentient embers. The camera glides around her in a circular motion, capturing the hypnotic flow of fire and the elegant sway of her dance. Sparks and fiery tendrils trail her limbs, illuminating the dark woods with a magical, fiery glow.
