Create a cinematic sunrise scene where a woman in a flowing black dress walks slowly through ancient ruins, her every step echoing in the quiet. The golden sun rises behind her, casting a warm glow that turns night into morning. Floating embers shimmer in the air, adding a sense of magic and transition. Her movements are calm, almost ceremonial, as she walks toward the light with a look of peace and quiet determination. The moment is serene, symbolizing the hopeful start of a brand new day.
