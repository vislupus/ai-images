The scene begins in a dimly lit space. A woman steps into view, wearing a luminous gown that glows like strands of starlight. As ambient music swells, she starts to move with slow, elegant gestures. The camera circles her as her dress pulses softly with light, casting reflections on the floor. Her dance is graceful and deliberate, like a ritual or silent story told through motion and light, holding the viewer in a trance-like state.
