The scene opens on a striking red-haired woman standing still as glowing particles begin lifting from her body, carried by an unseen wind. Fiery sparks swirl around her as she slowly dissolves into golden dust. The camera gently zooms in as her figure fades, leaving only her face—calm and smiling—floating momentarily in the air before it, too, disappears. A soft light glows where she once stood, marking a beautiful and emotional farewell.
