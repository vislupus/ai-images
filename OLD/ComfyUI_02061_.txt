The warrior woman stands still for a brief moment in the middle of a narrow, misty East Asian street, then turns and begins walking away from the camera with calm resolve. The camera follows behind, tracking her graceful movement as her flowing battle robe sways. The camera smoothly overtakes her, now facing her as she walks forward with unwavering strength and purpose, red lanterns and damp reflections illuminating her path.
