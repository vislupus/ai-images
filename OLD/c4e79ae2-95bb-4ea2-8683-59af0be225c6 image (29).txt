A cinematic fantasy scene where a powerful sorceress sits in the middle of a dark, mystical forest under a glowing full moon. She slowly raises her hands, summoning fiery magic that crackles and dances around her. The flames start small but quickly grow, spiraling around her body as her eyes glow with arcane energy. The fire spreads outward, consuming the trees, the ground, and the air itself, turning the entire landscape into an inferno of magical destruction. The scene ends with the sorceress standing amid the flames, unharmed, with an aura of unstoppable power.
