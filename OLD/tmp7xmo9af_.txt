A woman aboard a futuristic space station stands before a massive observation window. As she slowly turns to face the camera, her biomechanical armor begins to shift â€” golden lights ripple across its surface, reconfiguring like living circuitry. The camera smoothly moves around her, showing the Earth glowing in the background as her armor continues to morph. Her expression is serene and powerful, capturing the moment between technology, humanity, and the infinite cosmos.
