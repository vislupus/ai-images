In a mystical forest bathed in morning light, a vibrant young dragon takes its first steps across mossy ground. Its metallic scales glisten as it walks, and its crystalline horns catch beams of sunlight filtering through the trees. The camera follows alongside, capturing each movement—the sway of its tail, the thud of its claws on earth—as it explores the enchanted woodland with curious eyes and a majestic presence.
