A cinematic close-up sequence of a living sculpture slowly awakening, her lifelike stone features subtly moving as she approaches the camera. Her glowing golden eyes remain locked onto the viewer, her expression serene yet unnerving. The scene is bathed in soft, flickering candlelight, highlighting the gold and gemstone-encrusted jewelry adorning her neck and forehead. As she leans in closer, the camera captures the delicate movement of her lips, whispering an ancient incantation in a soft, hypnotic tone. The final frame is an extreme close-up of her marble lips, just as the whisper reaches its climax, before the screen fades to darkness.
