A cinematic animation of a mysterious sorceress walking under a glowing crescent moon. She holds a shimmering ice crystal in her palm, the cold mist surrounding it reflecting the world around her. As she approaches the viewer, she gracefully tosses the crystal into the air. In an instant, it fractures into three glowing shards, which begin to float and orbit around her, radiating an ethereal blue light. The reflections of the moon, the deep forest, and swirling autumn leaves dance within the crystal shards, creating a mesmerizing spectacle. The scene captures the sorceressâ€™s mastery over ice and light, as the fragments continue to swirl, illuminating her mystical presence.
