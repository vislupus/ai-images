A woman made of fire stands tall, her body glowing and flickering with powerful flames. As the camera slowly circles around her, the fire intensifies, becoming a blazing inferno. Sparks and embers spiral outward, and from the core of her flames, landscapes begin to formâ€”mountains of molten rock, glowing rivers, and skies lit with fiery clouds. The camera pulls back to reveal a new world being born from her flames, shaped by her presence as a celestial force of creation.
