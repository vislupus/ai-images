The scene begins with a close-up of a black-furred wolf warrior clad in dark, spiked armor. The camera slowly circles around him, and the ancient text on-screen fades into the shadows. With a sudden tilt of his head, he releases a chilling howl that echoes through the void. Sparks flicker across his armor, and the camera zooms out to reveal his imposing stance as his howl awakens the night.
