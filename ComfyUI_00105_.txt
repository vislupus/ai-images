A thunderstorm brews as the Dragon Queen steps forward, cloaked in shimmering, dragon-scale armor that shifts in hue with each movement. Her emerald crown glows as lightning strikes illuminate her fierce, unshakable expression. With a gust of wind and rising embers, she raises her hand and dragons roar in the distance. The camera circles around her, revealing her full majestyâ€”a sovereign of flame and scale, feared and revered.
