The camera slowly approaches a demon-like female commander standing amid fire-lit ruins. She reaches behind her and pulls a massive sword from her back, which immediately bursts into flames. As she lifts it, her armor ignites with glowing lava veins, each pulse matching the rhythm of her rising power. The heat distorts the air as the flames swirl higher. She raises her head and stares into the camera with intensity â€” the fire obeys her command, and she begins to march forward, each step shaking the scorched ground.
