A cinematic sequence featuring a demon queen performing a hauntingly elegant dance in a gothic hall. Her long black dress flows around her as she twirls, and her massive bat-like wings extend and contract rhythmically with her movements. The camera captures slow-motion shots of her piercing gaze, the delicate arch of her hands, and the hypnotic sway of her wings. Wisps of dark mist swirl around her feet, amplifying the supernatural aura. As the music intensifies, she leaps into the air, her wings fully unfurled, creating a breathtaking silhouette against the dim, moody backdrop. The scene ends with her locking eyes with the viewer, a smirk playing on her lips as if inviting them into her dark domain.
