The video opens with a glamorous sci-fi hallway. The woman enters the frame, hips swaying, cape trailing like a comet's tail. She’s clearly trying to look majestic for her date, who is filming. As she closes in, the camera retreats—again. She pauses, rolls her eyes, then speeds up ever so slightly. "Seriously? If this turns into a 40-minute runway walk, I’m hexing your camera," she mutters with a smirk.
