The necromancer witch begins walking slowly toward the viewer, casting a dark incantation with each step. Her eyes glow brighter, and the floor trembles as human skeletons claw their way from the ground, rising to follow her. Purple flames flicker in the shadows, illuminating the haunted cathedral. As she reaches the camera, she tilts her head with a playful, teasing smile and extends her hand, inviting the viewer to follow her into her mysterious, otherworldly realm.
